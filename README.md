# tldr-webapp
tiny webapp example

This webapp makes use of the library: "github.com/JesusIslam/tldr" <-- a Text summarizer for golang using LexRank

I will use this tiny web app as an example at the Brighton Gophers March meetup

The premise:

1) You can make quick dirty web applications with go and minimal lines of code!
