# quick webapps!
Tiny webapp examples aimed at beginners to Go.
One of the examples makes use of this library: https://github.com/JesusIslam/tldr <-- a Text summarizer for golang using LexRank.
I will use this as an example at the Brighton Gophers March meetup.

The premise:

1) You can make quick dirty web applications with go/html and minimal lines of code!
2) You're new to programming but skilled enough to build useful tools for colleages / friends / yourself.
3) You want to move away from the command line and create a simple but useful GUI.
