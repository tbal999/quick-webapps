# tldr-webapp
tiny webapp example aimed at beginners to go

This webapp makes use of the library: https://github.com/JesusIslam/tldr <-- a Text summarizer for golang using LexRank

I will use this tiny web app as an example at the Brighton Gophers March meetup

The premise:

1) You can make quick dirty web applications with go/html and minimal lines of code!
