# quick webapps!
Tiny webapp examples aimed at beginners to Go who want to move away from just building command line applications.

I will use these as examples at the Brighton Gophers March meetup.

One of the examples makes use of this library: https://github.com/JesusIslam/tldr <-- a Text summarizer for golang using LexRank.

The premise:

1) You can make quick dirty web applications with go/html and minimal lines of code!
2) You're still new to programming but skilled enough to build useful tools for colleagues / friends / yourself.
3) You want to move away from the command line and create a simple but useful GUI.
